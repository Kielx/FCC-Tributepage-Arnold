                        I was convinced a girl and I couldn't communicate on equal footing because she wouldn't understand what I was doing. I didn't have time to take one girl out regularly and go through a normal high-school romance with all its phone
                        calls and notes and squabbles. That took too much time. I needed to be in the gym. For me it was a simple matter of picking them up at the lake, and then never seeing them again."

                    <li><strong>Sept 22, 2005 - </strong> At a convention of the California Nurses Association, Warren Beatty says Schwarzenegger governs "by show, by spin, by cosmetics and photos ops." A spokesman for Schwarzenegger responds: "we don't care
                        that much about Warren Beatty, and based on his ticket sales from the past generation, I doubt anyone else does either."
